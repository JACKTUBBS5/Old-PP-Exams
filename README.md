# Old-PP-Exams This repository contains copies of recent PPP exams for Stat 5380 and Stat 5381.  The raw files are found within my Overleaf location

These exams reflect my believe that the students might know about some topics but very few can do anything with that knowledge except recite meanddingless facts. I would rather that they demonstrate how to solve a statistical problem rather than just tell me what they would do.

The exams are much less memory driven (even less math facts). I have found that the more recent students are very much math-challenged (they can't do math)

In order to do these exams one must know some SAS (much less than say 10 years ago) and RStudio.  I use to have muchmore linear alegbra and multivariate distributional type knowledge but alast they don't know this either. So what can they do?  These exams see if they can do anything that I taught during the two semesters.
